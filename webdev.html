            <h2>Web development as a whole</h2>
            <p class="p-b">Developing the web, involves front end and back end building of the user experience and any programing, logic and databases needed to complete a full stack development which utilizes user interfaces and server side technologies. Think of the front end as a website design that users can see when browsing the internet and think of back end as the server side which is usually a host that with code and many live servers housed in a cool enviroment in turn supports the code of the front end being seen by everyday individuals browsing the internet that visit websites designed by a website designer. Both the front end and back end make up the full stack.</p>
            <p class="p-b">On this page I will discuss in both easy to understand layman terms and experienced coder terms from what I know personally. For you to gain a deeper understanding than before. That is my intention anyway. I rememenr starting out and the overwhelmness I had. I will say this. It takes hours and hours and hours on top of hours and hours of practice and studying. You have to start witih the concept of ownership of really wanting it. To me it is like a puzzle of puzzles and each piece fits into part of a puzzle that fits into another puzzle. That's what I see anyway. It could be different for you. I think to myself, "I'll never know if I don't try."</p>

            <h2>Front end</h2>
            <p class="p-c">Coding languages, Libraries, Framworks</p>
            <h3>Website design and Web applications</h3>
            <p class="p-b">The big 3 coding languages for front end development.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>JAVASCRIPT</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="p-b">OTHER CODING LANGUAGES involved in front end development.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ELM</li>
                <li>PYTHON</li>
                <li>SWIFT</li>
                <li>TYPESCRIPT</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="p-b">LIBRARIES used in front end development. Libraries have components of code that speed up the development process by utilizing prewritten code for purposes that are often repeated by many other developers. So, instead of wrting the same code over and over again, each developer can seek out the components needed for their work. It's like getting an alternator for you car, then installing it. Versus building the alternator for your car, then then installing it. There are many libraries out there. Here are some of many.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>REACTJS</li>
                <li>JQUERY</li>
                <li>SWIFT</li>
                <li>TYPESCRIPT</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="p-b">FRAMEWORKS used in front end development.Frameworks are libraries of components of code that can speed up the develpment process like described above in the Libraries section. Although frameworks require a developer to go with the flow of the frameworks conventions, which are particular to each framework. There are many frameworks out there. Here are some of many.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>VUEJS</li>
            </ul>
