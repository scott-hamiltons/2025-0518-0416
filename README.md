Developing skills

So, I'm not familiar with figuring our how to fix error codes from VS. My solution to this problem is to start over with a fresh repository.

This repository is named by the time. Hopefully we won't need to make more repositories for the sake of avoiding errors.

My strategy for learning about GitHub moving forward is to move slower, so I may be able to detect what goes wrong and then list ny solutions some place like a journal.


Thnak you,
