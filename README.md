Another location to hopefully not get crowded with Git errors. I'm not entirely sure what went wrong with the 0422-2 folder, but it seems to have become corrupted, thus this new folder. I believe my mistake was moving files around hastily and deleting hastily. I need to not do that.

Thank you,
Scott Hamilton
