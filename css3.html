        The position of the gradient line's starting point. If specified, it consists of the word to and up to two keywords: one indicates the horizontal side (left or right), and the other the vertical side (top or bottom). The order of the side keywords does not matter. If unspecified, it defaults to to bottom.

        The values to top, to bottom, to left, and to right are equivalent to the angles 0deg, 180deg, 270deg, and 90deg, respectively. The other values are translated into an angle.

        <angle>
            The gradient line's angle of direction. A value of 0deg is equivalent to to top; increasing values rotate clockwise from there.

            <linear-color-stop>
                A color-stop's <color>
                    value, followed by one or two optional stop positions, (each being either a <percentage>
                        or a <length>
                            along the gradient's axis).

                            <color-hint>
                                An interpolation hint defining how the gradient progresses between adjacent color stops. The length defines at which point between two color stops the gradient color should reach the midpoint of the color transition. If omitted, the midpoint of the color transition is the midpoint between two color stops.
